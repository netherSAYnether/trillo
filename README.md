# trillo

Trillo app

This was a project created for Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course: Advanced CSS & Sass. Trillo was created with CSS variables, animations & transitions, SVG images, Flexbox, and media queries for responsive design. I had a lot of fun with this Sass code-along and plan to use many of the concepts learned in my own creations.
